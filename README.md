# CHILE
Chile-Harvard Innovative Learning Exchange

The Institute for Applied Computational Science and the Center for Mathematical Modeling at the University of Chile 
are partnering together to provide a team-based intercultural learning experience during J-term.
Students will work together with Chilean students in teams on a real-world computationally challenging problem drawn 
from a cutting-edge astronomical endeavor, the Dark Energy Camera. The trip will include a visit to the Cerro Tololo 
observatory (pictured above) to meet with the scientists who collect the data, and a presentation of the results back 
in Cambridge, MA at the Data Science Symposium at Harvard SEAS.

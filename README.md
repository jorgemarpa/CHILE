Chile-Harvard Innovative Learning Exchange

The Institute for Applied Computational Science and the Center for Mathematical Modeling at the University of Chile are partnering together to provide a team-based intercultural learning experience.
Harvard and Chilean students work together in teams on a real-world computationally challenging problem drawn from a cutting-edge astronomical endeavor, the Dark Energy Camera. The results are presented in Cambridge, MA at the Data Science Symposium at Harvard SEAS.
